== Device-specific notes

=== Hardware Revisions

This device has been through several hardware revisions: the kernel
describes P0A, P1A, P1B,P2A, P2A2, P2B, and P3A but that's not an
exhaustive list.  Each of these revisions corresponds to a separate
hardware configuration description (device tree) in the vendor kernel,
but on examination it turns out that several are identical to each
other. These identical DTBs take significant space, so to shrink the
boot image to fit in the allotted 16MB partition we have merged the
duplicates.

hwrev  board-id     (mis)features

P0A  <0x44 0x80a0>   U D
P1A  <0x44 0x81a0>   U D
P1B  <0x44 0x81b0>   D
P2A  <0x44 0x82a0>   D
     <0x45 0x82a0>   D
P2A2 <0x45 0x82a2> 
P2B  <0x45 0x82b0> 
P3A  <0x46 0x83a0> 
P3B  <0x46 0x83b0> 

By browsing the commit messages, we find

U = "Change usbid-gpio from 66 to 59" git sha 305e2610c598dc4e
D = "boost clock use pdm clock instead" git sha c42744ebf80da79a0

Thus,we can accommodate all revisions with three DTs:

- msm8953-potter-p0a-p1a.dtb   (contains U and D fixes)
- msm8953-potter-p1b-p2a.dtb   (contains D fix only)
- msm8953-potter-p2a2-plus.dtb (contains no fix)


==== What about P3B?

The vendor kernel does not include a device tree source with
appropriate board-id for hwrev P3B, but empirically (by consulting
`/proc/device-tree/board-id` on a device running Android) it looks like
the bootloader chooses the P3A DTB instead. As far as I understand it
this goes against the https://github.com/xiaolu/mkbootimg_tools/blob/master/dtbtool.txt[documented rules]
for choosing a device tree - https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/msm.git/+/android-msm-bullhead-3.10-n-preview-1/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/msm/board-id.txt?autodive=0%2F%2F%2F%2F[according to
sources]
the platform subtype is the lowest 8 bits of the second element of the
board-id, and clearly 0xa0 != 0xb0, but it seems to do it anyway.

If you have a device with a hwrev *after* P3B, I'd love to hear from
you about how it behaves in this regard.


=== Firmware for Wi-Fi

This particular phone keeps the firmware files on a partition named
`modem`.

To make use of the Wi-Fi capabilities of this phone you will need to
make them available to the firmware derivation.

The files can be acquired through different methods. You can use an
alternate recovery like TWRP, mount the partition (identified using
`blkid`) and copy the files.

Another way is to do it using an installed Mobile NixOS system, where,
too, you mount the partition and copy them:

```
$ sudo mount -o ro /dev/disk/by-partlabel/modem /mnt
$ cp -r /mnt ./modem
$ sudo umount /mnt
```

The copy of the firmware files will be in the modem directory, in the
current working directory, ready to be referred to.

=== Touchscreen

There seem to be three distinct versions of the Synaptics DSx
touchscreen driver in the vendor kernel: one in
`drivers/input/touchscreen/synaptics_*.[ch]/`, plus two others in
subdirectories `drivers/input/touchscreen/synaptics_dsx/`

Since commit 219587de9e92a in the vendor kernel, the touchscreen is
declared in the device tree as `compatible = "synaptics,dsx-i2c"`
which corresponds to the code in
`drivers/input/touchscreen/synaptics_dsx_2.6/`, but the kernel config
options specify a weird mismash of that code and and some of the files
in the parent folder. I tried cleaning this up but it broke more than
it fixed.

The option for CONFIG_SCREEN_OFF_GESTURES is disabled because it is
incompatible with CONFIG_FB
