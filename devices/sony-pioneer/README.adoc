== Device-specific notes

=== Fastboot

This device has a quirky way to get to fastboot.

* You have to have the device connected to a computer, or else it will not activate fastboot mode.
* Fastboot shows nothing on the display

With the phone connected to a computer, hold volume up and *somehow* cause a
reboot (from the system, or by holding power to force reset).

Alternatively, from a powered-off state, hold volume up and connect to your
computer.

Finally, you can always trigger a reboot to bootloader via software. From
within Mobile NixOS, `sudo reboot bootloader`, or from an Android-based system
using `adb reboot bootloader` or equivalent methods.

Note that the LED will light up blue when in fastboot mode.
